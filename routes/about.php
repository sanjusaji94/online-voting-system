                <p>Online voting systems are software platforms used to securely conduct votes and elections. This voting system can be used for casting votes during the elections held in colleges, etc. As a digital platform, they eliminate the need to cast your votes using paper or having to gather in person.
 
                    They also protect the integrity of your vote by preventing voters from being able to vote multiple times.
                     
                    Many secure voting platform vendors provide supportive vote management consulting services that help organizations design and implement their voting procedures.
                     
                    These services help organizations save time, stick to best practices, and meet internal requirements and/or external regulations, such as third-party vote administration needs.</p>

                <p?> In our website, there is provision for both voters and candidates to register, login and vote. There is a database which is maintained in which all the name of the voters and candidates along with their complete information is stored.
